//*Again, this is very similar to the logic in SingleThought.js. The useParams Hook retrieves the username from the URL, which is then passed to the useQuery Hook.

//*the addFriend() mutation returns an updated user object whose ID matches the me object already stored in cache. When the cache is updated, the useQuery(QUERY_ME_BASIC) Hook on the homepage causes a re-render.

// navigate to personal profile page if username is the logged-in user's
//*add functionality to the Profile component definition to check if the logged-in user's username is the same as the parameter, and redirect if so.
//*if the username stored in the JSON Web Token is the same as the userParam value. If they match, we return the <Navigate> component with the prop to set to the value /profile, which will redirect the user away from this URL and to the /profile route.
//*The Navigate component is extremely useful, so make sure you take a moment or two to learn itâ€”and keep it in mind as you build future applications!
